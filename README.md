# MPII Human Pose Visualization <br>

![096244729.jpg](/results/viz_gt/096244729.jpg)

Loading and Visualizing MPII Human Pose dataset in Python. <br>
The Jupyter notebook ```mpii_visualization.ipynb``` in the ```notebooks``` folder demostrates reading and interpreting the MPII human pose dataset. <br>
Sample output visualizations are available in ```results/viz_gt```.

Before executing the notebook, download and paste all the MPII images ```*.jpg``` from ```http://human-pose.mpi-inf.mpg.de/#download```in the directory ```data/mpii/images/*.jpg```.
